README

This project is an Authorization Microservice built to operate as a standalone application in a
microservice architecture. OAuth2.0 authorization protocol is used to issue and verify access
tokens for new and existing Users. Django Guardian is used to issue permissions to Users and Groups
which will determine the scope of a User's access token. Access token scopes are used by other
applications to restrict access to information/actions.

GETTING STARTED

These steps must be completed to begin using the service.

1) Make sure requirements.txt is satisfied.
2) Go to /admin and log in to the admin site (ask nicely for login info)
3) WHILE LOGGED IN AS ADMIN, Go to /o/applications to create an application to be used with this
    Authorization Microservice
    IMPORTANT:
     * If you are not logged in as admin you cannot access o/applications
     * If you are creating a moblie application, check the "Persistent" flag to issue persistent
       access tokens. If you are creating a web application, leave "Persistent" unchecked.
4) Use /signup to create new Users
5) Use /login to authenicate a User's credentials and issue an access token


TODO:
A bad 'app_name' passed in the payload throws a 500 error. Should we handle this in a try/catch,
or expect that devs will pass properly
